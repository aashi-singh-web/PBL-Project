# Pathwise: Navigate Your Future with Confidence

## Abstract
Navigating the transition from college to the professional world can be challenging. Many students struggle with skill development due to overwhelming online information and expensive mentorship. Pathwise simplifies this process by offering a user-friendly, AI-driven platform that provides personalized learning paths based on students' interests, strengths, and career goals.

## Objectives
- To analyze the challenges students face in career planning and skill development.
- To design an AI-powered platform that provides personalized learning paths and career guidance.
- To integrate both technical and soft skills into a single platform for holistic career readiness.
- To offer mentorship opportunities by connecting students with industry professionals and seniors.

## Features
- **Personalized Skill Assessment**: Uses questionnaires and assessments to determine current skills, interests, and career goals.
- **Curated Learning Resources**: Provides a pre-curated list of courses, video lectures, and study materials tailored to specific skill gaps.
- **Soft Skill Development Modules**: Offers interactive modules for communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
- **Mentorship & Networking**: Connects students with industry professionals and alumni for guidance and career insights.
- **Progress Tracking & Feedback**: Monitors students' learning journeys and provides feedback to optimize learning paths.
- **Event Calendar**: Lists upcoming hackathons, internships, and tech events to facilitate industry exposure.
- **Portfolio Building**: Allows students to create portfolios showcasing real-world projects and receive peer and mentor feedback.
- **Hybrid Mentorship Model**: Combines AI-driven and real-world mentor guidance for round-the-clock career assistance.
- **Adaptive Learning Goals**: Adjusts learning paths based on user progress, availability, and professional commitments.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: Google Maps, Payment Gateway (Stripe/PayPal), Translation Services
- **AI/ML Integration**: Recommendation engines, user profiling, and dynamic pricing.

## Development Phases
1. **Research & Requirements Gathering**: Understand students' challenges in career planning and skill development.
2. **Design Phase**: UI/UX designs and database schema creation.
3. **Development Phase**: Building the front and back end and integrating APIs.
4. **Testing Phase**: Unit, integration, user, performance, and security testing.
5. **Launch Phase**: Deployment and marketing.
6. **Maintenance & Updates**: Regular updates based on user feedback.

## Literature Survey
Existing career guidance platforms lack customized skill development and soft skills training. While platforms like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Udemy offer structured courses, they are paid and lack mentorship. Roadmap.sh and Khan Academy provide free resources but do not offer personalized learning paths. MentorCruise focuses on mentorship but is expensive.

- Limited personalization in career roadmaps.
- Mentorship is either unavailable or costly.
- Soft skills training is not a priority.
- Overwhelming information without structured guidance.

## Conclusion
Pathwise aims to revolutionize career guidance by offering a comprehensive, personalized skill development platform. Integrating AI-driven learning paths, mentorship, soft skills training, and real-world exposure empowers students to confidently navigate their careers.

With a user-centric approach and cutting-edge technology, Pathwise stands as a one-stop solution for students seeking clarity, growth, and success in their professional journeys.
